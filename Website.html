    <p>Rating: 8/10</p>
    <p>Reason: This is a very fun game and one of my favorite console games. It has to do with my favorite sport, and it is very easy to learn the controls and become a skillful player. The downsides are that the mode where you make your own team, which is the most played one, is very pay to win (you can pay to get ahead). All the players at the top get there by buying the best players with a lot of in game cash, which they buy with real money.</p>
     &nbsp;
    <p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
    <ul>
<li>Can play with friends</li>
<li>Easy to play and learn</li>
</ul>
     <p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
    <ul>
<li>Pay to win (can pay to get ahead)</li>
<li>Sometimes laggy</li>
</ul>

    <p>Reason: It is a very fun game and you can play with your friends. It is also convenient because due to the fact that it is mobile, you can play anywhere. The games are only 3-4 minutes long, and you can play anytime. The downside of this game is that a lot of people get ahead by paying for items, which results in a non-even playfield</p>
     &nbsp;
     <p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
    <ul>
<li>Can play with friends</li>
<li>Mobile so you can play anywhere</li>
<li>Short games that can be played anytime</li>
</ul>
     <p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
    <ul>
<li>Pay to win (can pay to get ahead)</li>
<li>Can be very frustrating</li>
</ul>

    <p><strong><u>#1 CS:GO(Counter-Strike: Global Offensive)</u></strong></p>
     <img class="img-rounded img-responsive" src="http://media.steampowered.com/apps/valvestore/images/slider/store_image_02.png" alt="CS:GO">
     &nbsp;
    <p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is an online first-person shooter video game developed by Hidden Path Entertainment and Valve Corporation. It is the fourth, and best, game in the main Counter-Strike franchise. There are 3 different game modes in this game. Competitive, which is a 5v5 where the first to 16 rounds win. There are two sides, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists. The Terrorist side tries to plant the bomb at either of two locations, and the Counter-Terrorists try to defuse the bomb if they do. Either side wins the round if all the players on the other die. Competetive games count towards your in-game rank. Another gamemode, casual is the same except it doesn't count towards your ranking. The last gamemode, deathmatch, is a free for all where there are teams. You respawn when you die, and you try to get as many kills as you can.</p>

    <p>Rating: 10/10</p>
    <p>Reason: This is a very fun game and my favorite pc game by far. It is not pay to win at all, meaning spending money will not put you ahead of everyone else. The only thing you can buy are skins, which are different designs on your guns. These are cool, but do not make you or the guns better. The only downside would be that the average game is about 30-40 mins long, but you just have to plan for that. Other than that, this game is amazing and I highly recommend playing it.</p>
     &nbsp;
     <p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
    <ul>
<li>Can play with friends</li>
<li>Computer game, so can be played on very high graphics</li>
<li>Not pay to win so everyone has an even chance to be good</li>
</ul>
     <p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
    <ul>
<li>Long games that you have to open space for (30mins - 1hr)</li>
<li>Whether you win or lose depends on your teamates' skills as much as yours </li>
</ul>
